Ring algorithm:
This algorithm is  applied to systems organized as a ring logically or physically.
In this alg we assume that the link between the process are unidirectional and every process can manage to process to its right only.

DAta structure that this algorithm uses is active list  alist that has priority number of all active process  in the system


Berkleys algorithm is a physical clock synchronization algorithm.
each is node in the system does not have the accurat time.
as they are geographically spread so each has a different time


pass1: time daemon (master node) request timestanps from all the slaves nodes
pass2: slave node respond their timestamp to master node
pass3:master node computes fault tolerant average
pass4:this avg time differrence is addded to the current masters time system and broadcast over the network.

NOw they can commuincate in the synchronous manner.
